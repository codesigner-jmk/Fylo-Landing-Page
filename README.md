## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Email validation

### The Overview

This project replicates the design of the “Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page” challenge: a single-page, modern landing page focused on a cloud-file-storage concept. The goal: practice layout techniques (Flexbox & CSS Grid), mobile-first design, semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, and responsive behaviours.
It showcases:

- Hero section with strong headline and call-to-action
- Features grid section
- Testimonials section
- Email-capture form (early-access)
- Footer with site map and contact info

## My process

### Features

- Mobile-first responsive layout: adapts from small screen to large desktop
- Clean semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables) for colour palette, typography, spacing
- Use of Flexbox and Grid for layout sections
- Hover and focus states on interactive elements for accessibility and UX
- Consistent design following the provided style guide (fonts, colours, spacing)
- Deployment via GitHub Pages (easy sharing and portfolio use)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 (including custom properties, Flexbox, CSS Grid)
- [Gsap](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind css](https://nextjs.org/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

I’m most proud of completing the entire Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page using Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and GSAP for animations. It was my first time working with GSAP, so being able to bring the page to life with smooth scroll and motion effects felt like a big win. I’m also proud of how cohesive and clean the final design turned out. If I were to do it again, I’d plan my animation structure earlier in the project. That would help me organize the GSAP timelines and scroll triggers more efficiently, instead of adjusting them after the layout was done.

### Improvements & Next Steps

Some areas to enhance:
- Accessibility: add ARIA attributes, ensure full keyboard navigation, colour contrast review.
- Performance: optimize images (e.g., WebP), lazy-load large illustrations, minify CSS.
- Light / Dark Theme toggle: allow users to switch theme dynamically.
- Multi-page expansion: convert into a multi-page site with additional content (Pricing, Blog, Contact).
- CSS architecture: adopt a pre-processor (Sass/SCSS) or CSS-in-JS for scalability.

### Useful resources

- [Gsap Documentation](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/) - This helped me with installation and basic understanding of GSAP, as it was my first time ever using the library.
- [The Code Creative Channel](https://youtu.be/WEky7V490Rs?si=E9qvLuRPnPzcIy8P) - This is an amazing youtube channel which helped me finally understand the use of ScrollTrigger and ScrollSmoother. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
